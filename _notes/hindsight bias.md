Looking back at an event (situation, decision, etc.) in the past, from the perspective of  _today_, i.e. without accounting for the fact that more information is available now than was back then.
This bias can sometimes trick us into forgetting the probabilistic nature of decisions, i.e. thinking (wrongfully, based on today's information) that a specific outcome was inevitable.
