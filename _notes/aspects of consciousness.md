3 main aspects of [[consciousness]]:
- Conscious level
- Conscious contents
- Conscious [[self]]

Conscious level is the fact of being conscious, as opposed to a dreamless sleep (or under general anaesthesia).

Conscious contents are our experiences while being conscious - sensations, thoughts, emotions, etc.

Conscious self is that part of the conscious contents related the specific experience of _[[self|being you]]_.
