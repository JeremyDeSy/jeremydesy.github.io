Viktor Frankl shared his view on [[Viktor Frankl on believing in others|how to help others actualize their potential]].
This would be an important principle in the context of [[leadership]]. By believing (and showing) people can be more than they currently are, you'll invite them to surpass themselves.

On the other hand, this could also backfire: by always expecting them to be more/better than they currently are, they might start feeling discouraged that they will never achieve anything (in your eyes).
The best way to address this is probably to make sure you acknowledge "intermediate achievements", before encouraging them to do even better.
How big this risk is, is related to how much of a [[growth mindset]] the person has. The more growth mindset they'll have, the less likely they are to be discouraged by ever-increasing expectations, and need intermediate "pats on the back".

This reasoning not only applies to professional leadership, but to any human relationship where you're trying to help the person improve (a.o. [[parenting]] or even romantic relationships)
