Taking a step back to contemplate events from a distance can backfire.
By taking this step back, we lose touch with the concerns/commitments which provide reasons to anything we do.
If one steps back far enough, all justifications disappear.

#question :
- Do I agree with this?
- Are these concerns/commitments justified?
