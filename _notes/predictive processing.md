2 opposed views of [[perception]]:
- Outside in
- Inside out

The outside in views implies that sensory inputs flow to the inside of the brain to be interpreted/processed.

The inside out view (or Helmholtzian view, after [[Herman von Helmholtz]]'s idea of the [[brain as prediction machine]]) inverts this framework.
In this view, the signals flowing outside in only carry [[prediction errors]], while the [[prediction]] is carried inside out.
[[perception|Perception]] is then just the minimization of [[prediction errors]] at different levels of processing, by updating the brain's [[prediction|predictions]].
This concept is called **predictive processing**.

Using predictive processing, [[hallucination|hallucinations]] could be explained as the brain not paying enough attention to sensory signals.
