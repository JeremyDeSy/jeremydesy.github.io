Our ancient [[belief]] formation system was mostly based on [[senses|sensory input]] and consisted of the following steps:
1. Experience something (hear, see, etc.)
2. Form our belief
3. Rarely revise

This process is due to the evolutionary push towards efficiency rather accuracy.

As language developed, so did our capability for abstract belief formation (i.e. beliefs outside our direct experience, conveyed through language). However, our belief formation system did not adapt, thereby leading to the following process:
1. Hear something
2. Believe it's true (related to [[truth default theory]])
3. Rarely revise
