Open tasks tend to occupy our short term memory, until they are done.
However, the brain doesn't distinguish between an actually finished task, and a postponed one (f.e. by creating a note).

How can this effect be leveraged?
- Removing unanswered questions from our short term memory by writing them down (this is why the [[GTD metholodogy]] is effective)
- Break down large tasks into smaller tasks which can be executed in one go. The outcome of our thinking (incl. connections) can then be written down, so we can pick things up from where we left.
- Deliberately keep unanswered questions in your mind, to give our brain the opportunity to process it even while doing something else.
