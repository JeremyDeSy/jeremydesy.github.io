Term coined by [[Anil Seth]].

Temporal thickness refers to the ability to predict things that have not happened yet or might not happen at all, thanks to internal models of oneself and the world.
These can be thicker and thinner, deeper or shallower, depending on how far forward they predict, as well as how far back they postdict (whether they can capture how things might have ended up if they had acted differently).
This is called counterfactual depth.
