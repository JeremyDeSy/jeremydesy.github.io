My [[second brain]] has two main functions:
1. A Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system
2. A digital garden

One of the overarching objectives of my [[second brain]] is to shift "resources" from _consuming_ to _producing_ contents.

# PKM system
My PKM system is aimed at storing all kinds of information, for later retrieval and use.
I'm trying to implement this part using Tiago Forte's PARA method (possibly in a somewhat modified version).

# Digital garden
My [[1_welcome|digital garden]] is a place to collect interesting insights/ideas/concepts (from books, blog posts, etc.) in the form of interconnected notes.
I don't have a well-defined objective for starting this project. That being said, there are a few reasons I think this might be valuable or interesting:
- I feel a genuine interest and drive for learning new things and exploring new ideas
- I don't have an effective system for retaining information I come across, which somewhat feels like a waste of efforts/time.
My expectation, from reading about the digital garden concept, is that it will lead to new ideas/insights. However - considering I don't have a _creative_ job (contrary to what seems to be the case for many of the digital garden examples I've come across - Maggie Appleton, NessLabs, Andy Matuschak, etc.), it is still somewhat unclear whether and how I would be able to leverage these possible insights.
I guess I'll have to take a shot: experiment with this for a while and see what comes out of it.

# Tools
I'm be using Obsidian as the main tool for my [[second brain]].
I'm also still using Trello for practical project management (both personal and professional). I created a [public board](https://trello.com/b/Va0C0XZa/2nd-brain) for my 2nd brain project.
