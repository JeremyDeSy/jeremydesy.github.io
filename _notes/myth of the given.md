_Just by smelling Parmesan, you don't know what Parmesan is_

Our senses give us [[impression]], which in turn can form building blocks for [[knowledge]] (ideas, thoughts, speech, etc.)
This myth argues that this transition (from impressions to ideas) is not automatic:  it requires _learning_ about these ideas.
The main argument relates to the different orders to which these concepts belong:
- Sensations/[[impression]] are not _about_ things, they can't be true or false; they belong to the [[causal order]]
- Ideas can be correct or incorrect; they belong to the [[normative order]] (the space of reasons).

This idea was developed by [Wilfrid Sellars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid_Sellars)

This idea is related to that of [[a priori knowledge]].
