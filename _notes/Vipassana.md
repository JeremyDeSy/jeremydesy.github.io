Deep insight into the nature of the mind and of the phenomenal world

\- [[2008_MatthieuRicard_TheArtOf_Meditation]] (pp. 73)

Is complementary to [[Samatha]].

# Goals
From a psychological standpoint: to eradicate the three unwholesome factors, which are the cause of all unhappiness according to the [[Buddha]]:
- attachment
- anger
- delusion

Philosophically: to see things (or [[reality]]) as they truly are i.e. without judgment or free from _obsessions_ (~ [[impression]] according to [[Epictetus]])

Develop a state of uninterrupted [[mindfulness]].

# Meditation objects
- Initial or secondary
- Don't think about or add value to them => just observe (notice for 3/4 times) and return to the initial object
- Bodily sensations make for good objects when they are predominant; when they're no longer dominant, return to the initial object
## Thoughts
Meditate on thoughts by simply being/becoming aware of their arising - that the mind is thinking - without getting caught up/involved in them.
Meditation on thoughts helps seeing through their impersonal nature, and break the our identification with the thought process ([[aphorisms#^fa14b4|I am not my thoughts]]")

# Applications of mindfulness
Vipassana focus on one or more of the following four applications (fields) of mindfulness:
- Mindfulness of the body: breath, sensations, movements and postures
- Mindfulness of feeling: notice these as they arise and pass away, without clinging to the pleasant or condemning the unpleasant. When feelings become strong, they (can) become the objects of meditation
- Mindfulness of consciousness: notice the [[consciousness#The knowing faculty]] and its mental states with choiceless observation, so they don't disturb the mind
- Mindfulness of the Dharma

# Distractions
When something arises which is strong enough to distract you from the object of meditation, switch the attention to the distraction briefly and ask yourself:
- What is it?
- How strong is it?
- How long does it last?

## Intentions

While meditating (and even outside of formal practice) it's important to be aware of intentions preceding any movement or action
