The outer scorecard reflects how others perceive us. The inner scorecard reflects how we see ourselves.
Focusing on the reputation, praise, etc. (i.e. the outer scorecard), while compromising our own principles (i.e. the inner scorecard), leads to [[happiness|unhappiness]].
This explains how people appearing successful (on the outside) can still feel miserable (on the outside).

This relationship can also be represented as 

    Life Satisfaction Score = (outer score) / (inner score)

This concept can be viewed in the context of the [[dichotomy of control]]:
- The inner scorecard is within our control
- The outer scorecard is not.
