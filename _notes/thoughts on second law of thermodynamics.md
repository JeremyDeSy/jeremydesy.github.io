![[second law of thermodynamics]]

# What it means to me
The second law of thermodynamics fascinates me because of its applicability to so many aspects of our lives.
Anything we care about (people, relationships, objects, etc.) is embodied in a specific configuration of molecules, i.e. a local pocket of lower entropy. If left unattended, this configuration will tend to disappear, as entropy inevitably increases.
Therefore, anything we care about, requires our investment of energy (effort) in order to be maintained (let alone improved).
Examples of applications of the second law:
- Relationships require investment of energy (time) in order to last
- Your house will always become dirtier and less tidy, and requires effort to maintain

# On being alive
Being alive is essentially a constant battle against the second law of thermodynamics: being (and staying) alive requires maintaining the (physical) integrity of your body, i.e. the specific configuration they embody. ( #question what about the mind?)
