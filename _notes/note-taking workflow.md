Steps:
1. Make fleeting notes for later processing > these go into your [[0_inbox]]
2. Make literature notes when reading > these go into your reference system
	- Literature notes should be selective, short and in your own words
3. Make permanent notes
	- One idea per note
	- Written as if for someone else
4. Add permanent notes to slip-box
	- Create links to other notes
	- Link the note in the index or an [[entry point note]]
