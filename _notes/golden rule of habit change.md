Leverage/respect the [[habit loop]]: maintain the cue and reward, but swap the routine, i.e. modify the behavior that makes us feel good.

Accepting that our minds have evolved to be competitive, change the features we use to compare ourselves to others. F.e. get pleasure from doing things which are hard for most other people (f.e. admitting errors).
