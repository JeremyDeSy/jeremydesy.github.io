# Living
- Into every life, some rain must fall (https://dailydad.com/prepare-because-its-inevitable)
- It's not about what you accomplish, it's about what you become
- Do not live for the future
- The quality of the journey has to become more important than reaching your destination
- You can only make the most of your life, one moment at a time

# Thinking
- Be forgiving with your past [[self]]. Be strict with your present self. Be flexible with your future self
- If you're not seeking approval, they have no power
	- related to [[Stoicism#^c7dd29|dichotomy of control]]
- There are 3 primary drivers of results in life: your luck ([[randomness]]), your strategy (choices) and your actions (habits). Only 2 out of 3 are under your control, but if you master those 2, you can improve the odds that luck will work for you rather than against you
- Pain is inevitable, suffering is not
- No one owes you anything
- A mind kept open will take something from every new experience
- Less certainty, more inquiry
- Life is available only in the present moment
- Life requires you to learn about things while the answer is in the process of being decided
- Don't let failure go to your heart and don't let success go to your head
- Not being wrong is not the ultimate state of being for people in this life (Sam Harris)
- I am not my thoughts ^fa14b4
- Pleased but never satisfied
- Anger is ignorance
- Freedom is a calm mind
- Your thoughts are not orders, merely suggestions. You have the power to choose which option to follow
- There is nothing special to be, nothing special to do, nothing special to have ([[2020_JosephGoldstein_TheExperienceOfInsight]], p. 137)
- This too shall pass
- You are not who you think you are, but you are condemned to be who you think you are (paradox to be surmounted constantly)

# Doing
- A trained mind is the source of happiness; an untrained one of misery
- Invest the best hours of your day on the biggest opportunity, not the biggest problem
- Not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced
- Everything worthwhile is uphill
- The pain of trying and failing ends quickly. The pain of failing to try lasts forever
- When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion - you fall to your highest level of preparation
- The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials
- Each day is a new battle to say yes to what matters and say no to what doesnâ€™t. Focus is a practice
- People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures
- Mistakes of ambition teach. Mistakes of sloth comfort
- Motion does not equal action. Busyness does not equal effectiveness
- Success is never due to one thing, but failure can be. Many things are necessary, but not sufficient for success
- It's all just one long poker game (see also [[taking the long view]])
- Intensity makes a good story. Consistency makes progress.
	- In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term you are only as good as your consistency
- Study as if you know nothing. Work as if you can solve anything
- Every action is a step toward or away from you what you want
- When the world seems uncontrollable, focus on what you can control
- Seek to understand before being understood
- The lack of patience changes the outcome
- What you feed yourself today is who you become tomorrow
- The first step to being courageous is being willing to look foolish
- Results follow obsession
- Fail small, not big
- What you did in the past makes a good story; what you're doing now makes a difference
- Compete with yourself and root for everybody else
- People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care (Theodore Roosevelt) #quote


# Parenting
- To a kid, there is no such thing as a short pencil ([[Ryan Holiday]])
- Kids do well when they can

# Working
- Blijf nooit op een plek waar niemand uw waarde ziet
	- De juiste plek waardeert je op de juiste manier
	- Als je niet gewaardeerd wordt, wees dan niet boos, het betekent dat je op de verkeerde plek bent

# Productivity
- Your inbox is someone else's To Do list
