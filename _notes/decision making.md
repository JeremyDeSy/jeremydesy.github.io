Taking a [[decision]] = allocating resources (attention, money, time, etc.)

Most decisions are based on probabilistic outcomes. The quality of such decisions (a.o. whether they were _good or bad_) should not be determined based on the actual outcome (cf. [[resulting]]) but rather by the process that was followed to come to the decision.

Probabilistic choices (decisions) are distributed on a continuum, each with their own probability. There are a range of possible outcomes between the extremes of unequivocal right or wrong. Any choice in that space is completely right or wrong ("the 2nd best choice is less wrong that the 3rd or 4th best").

In order to improve our decision making abilities, we should first [[outcome fielding|field outcomes]] accurately and identify what was in our control (i.e. due to skill). We can then try to learn what we could have done better. (related to the [[dichotomy of control]]).
Improving our decision (the bets we make) typically involves improving the calibration of our beliefs to better represent the world. The better our beliefs, the better our bets/decision. (related to [[Bayesian thinking]])
