The essence of consciousness is that it feels like something to be _you_ and having an individual perspective on the world.

# The knowing faculty
In his [[2020_JosephGoldstein_TheExperienceOfInsight|book]]; Joseph Goldstein refers to consciousness as the "knowing faculty".
Goldstein differentiates between two separate processes, which happen simultaneously with every phenomenon (and are tightly connected): the object itself (a movement, thought, etc.); and the _knowing of it_. He calls the latter, consciousness.
During formal practice, Goldstein recommends to sometimes turn the attention on the knowing. This helps reach the insight that this _observation is without observer_. This is closely related to Sam Harris' advice to "look for what's looking".
