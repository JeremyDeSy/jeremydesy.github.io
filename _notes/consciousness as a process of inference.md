Being conscious is about trying to understand ([[inference]]) the causes of sensory inputs, and trying to navigate the world by minimizing [[Lyapunov function#^7c8c30]].

Not all [[inference|inferential processes]] are conscious, the distinction lies in the way inference is made about action and time.
In order to predict the consequences of actions, a creature must have a model of the future (aka [[counterfactual depth]]).
