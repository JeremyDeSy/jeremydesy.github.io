How does the [[dichotomy of control]] (DOC) relate to [[mindfulness]]?

The DOC urges us to focus on what is up to us, or depends on us.
When put in the context of [[time]], this means we should focus on the present moment, as this is the only portion we can (directly) influence.
Focusing on the present moment, and not minding the past of future, is exactly what mindfulness is about.
