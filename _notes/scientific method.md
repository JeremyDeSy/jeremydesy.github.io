True science doesn't consist of trying to verify (prove) something but rather to invalidate it and - if you don't succeed - strengthen it. In other words, true science should be [[falsifiability|falsifiable]]. 
Being irrefutable is not a virtue for a theory, but rather a vice.

Science is at its best when it produces [[theory|theories]], which are able to predict something that hasn't happened before.
