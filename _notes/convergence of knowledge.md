Bruno de Finetti explained how our [[knowledge]] can converge, and become shared, using [[Bayesian thinking]].

If we apply Bayesian thinking based on real events, our beliefs will converge, irrespective of our respective "starting positions".
So, despite the lack of absolute certainty, we can develop a common knowledge, which is justifiable and reliable (because the underlying probabilities are based on real life events)

This idea is similar to how the [[scientific method]] uses experiments to disprove theories. If the experiment does not disprove the theory, the probability of it being correct increases. At some point, a theory can have such a high probability (i.e. so many experiments confirming it), that it becomes unreasonable and wasteful to doubt it.

#question 
- The above implies that real life events unequivocally translate to an update of the corresponding probabilities? Is that the case? What if different people interpret events as meaning different things, therefore not leading to a similar update of probability?
- What is the tipping point between belief & knowledge?
