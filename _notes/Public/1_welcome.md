**Welcome to my digital garden**

This is a place where I collect information (ideas, concepts, etc.) found (mostly) while reading, as well as personal ideas, in the form of interconnected notes.
Personal ideas would typically combine other existing notes (or at least, that's the plan), and would typically _grow_ from "seedling" to "budding" to "evergreen" (I "stole" this terminology from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)). Although, admittedly, you'll only see seedlings, currently.

My current areas of interest are:
- [[meditation MOC|Meditation]]
- Thinking & learning (a.o. [[mental models]], [[mental biases]], [[decision making]])
- Philosophy - [[Stoicism]] in particular
- [[scientific method|Science]] - Physics in particular (a.o. nature of time and [[reality]], [[entropy]])

I'm also fascinated by [[consciousness]] (and the [[mind]] in general), which does seem to fit in multiple areas mentioned above.
