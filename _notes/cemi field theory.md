_What is the link between consciousness and the brain's electromagnetic field?_

Neurons can only carry 1 bit of information (firing or not), which gives rise to the [[binding problem]].

When firing, neurons emit a subtle electromagnetic (EM) pulse. When mulitple neurons fire, the resulting EMP's interfere to create a single (unified) EM field.
The cemi theory proposes that [[consciousness]] is the result of the brain internal structure _feeling_ this EM field. This is a possible answer for the binding problem.

The cemi field theory also proposes an explanation for the difference between our conscious and non-conscious minds.
Our non-conscious mind is able to handle multiple processes in parallel, while the conscious mind can only deal with one thread at a time (serial processing).
According to the cemi theory, this difference is due to the fact that the non-conscious mind operates based on the (parallel) processing of bits by neurons, while the conscious mind works complex ideas encoded in the unified EM field.
McFadden therefore considers ideas to be the computation unit of consciousness, calling them _conscious bits_ or _cbits_.
