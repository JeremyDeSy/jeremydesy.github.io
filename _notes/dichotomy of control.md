_Some things are under our control, some things aren't_

From [[Epictetus]]'s Enchiridion:
> Some things are within our power while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing.

But [[what is control]]]]?
