Humans have a tendency to look for improving a situation, knowledge, item, etc. by _adding_ to it. It is often also possible (maybe even better) to optimize by subtracting.
Possible reasons for systematically overlooking subtraction:
- Taking away might mean that previous additions were sunk costs
- The impression/misunderstanding that if something exists, it must so for a reason
- [[loss aversion|Loss aversion]]
- The [[Ikea effect]]
