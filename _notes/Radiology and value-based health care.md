- short-term costs/investments in imaging can generate long-term and system-wide savings (inappropriate treatments and investigations) and better outcomes
- radiology often viewed as _cost_, ignoring value created
- how can radiology be viewed as a creator of value (rather than potential source of value loss)
	- various contributions of radiology to patient care
	- quantify effect on patient outcomes and quality of life
	- highlight bottlenecks that can occur when undersupplying radiology (and other shared services)
		- eg delay patient throughput and discharge
- radiologists should help define/create value and optimize yield from their services
	- use available tools (ao [[artificial intelligence]]) to optimize workflow by minimizing patient [[waiting times]] and shorten [[hospital stays]]
	- maintain culture of constant [[quality]] monitoring and improvement
