Seeking feedback in order to learn, or more generally, _grow_.

Having a growth mindset implies getting pleasure from improving (which is inwardly rewarding) rather than praise (which is outwardly rewarding). In other words, it means paying more attention to the [[inner vs outer scorecard|inner scorecard]], than the outer scorecard.

A growth mindset is different (potentially complementary) from having a [[goals mindset]].
