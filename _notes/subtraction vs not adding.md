Saying _no_ to something, (i.e. not adding) is not the same as [[subtraction]].
Subtraction implies _removing_ something.
In terms of [[personal productivity]], saying no is only the first steps, which should be followed by actually removing actions from what we were doing, in order to focus on higher value/priority tasks.
