In the context of [[decision making]].

Lesson: actively planning for bad things to happen, increases [[resilience]].

Methods:
- Creating [[optionalilty]], by positioning oneself for multiple futures
- Building a [[margin of safety]]
	- Rule of thumb: 2x the worst possible outcome
	- Adapt it to the consequentiality and the level or risk or uncertainty of outcomes

Optimizing for today versus tomorrow:
- Looking like an idiot in the short term, to win in the long term
- Average behavior generates average results => need to correctly deviate from standard (see [[advantageous divergence]])
