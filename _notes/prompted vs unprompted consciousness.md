Two types of [[consciousness]]:
- Prompted: the mind that deliberates before acing
- Unprompted: the mind that acts very spontaneously

By practicing a particular action enough, it no longer needs to be deliberated and can be executed spontaneously, i.e. the action moves from the prompted to the unprompted consciousness.
This approach seems closely related to [[habit formation]].

This concept is very similar to [[system 1 vs system 2]].
