# Workflow
My PKM workflow consist of four (consecutive) phases:
1. Content consumption: this phase includes any activity related to the consumption of (new) [[content]]. My primary sources are: (audio-)books, articles, podcasts & videos
2. Content capture: while consuming content, I actively capture specific information/insights that resonate with me. This activity can take on multiple forms, depending on the source: marking clips in audiobooks, highlighting/writing marginalia in books, taking notes in my personal notebook. 
3. Content processing: regularly, I review the content captured above, select what still resonates and insert this my second brain. Ideally, when doing this, the "bits" inserted should be reduced to their most basic (atomic) form, in order to make them (re-)usable in the next phase
4. Content creation: in this phase, new (and own) ideas would emerge and be developed, leveraging the units of knowledge gathered over the previous phases. Admittedly - as of today - I haven't yet gotten to this phase.

This workflow is inspired on Tiago Forte's CODE framework: **C**apture - **O**rganize - **D**istill - **E**xpress.
It is also closely related to the framework of [[7 levels of content consumption]].

# Time investment
The various phases in my PKM workflow are typically executed as follows:
- 1 & 2: throughout the week (reading books at night, articles during the day, audiobooks while doing sport, etc.)
- 3: one or two sessions per week (each lasting anywhere from 45 to 90'), typically on Thursday and Saturday evening
- 4: one session (lasting about 60'), typically on Wednesday morning

#question 
- Is this enough time?
- Does the ratio between the various phases make sense?

# What (not) to store
I don't want my 2nd brain to become another Wikipedia (which wouldn't work anyway), so I'll have to be selective in what to capture. Tiage Forte has another framework for this task, which does resonate with me. His advice is to only save items which are:
- Inspiring (to you)
- Useful (here he makes the reference to the concept of a [[swipe file]])
- Easily lost
- Personal

# Important tags
- \#question: questions to myself
- \#draft: note describing a concept or idea (not my own) which are not finalized yet
- \#task: task or question I still need to tackle (typically in the professional context)
- \#idea: original idea from someone else
- \#thought: my own thoughts, reflections, ideas
