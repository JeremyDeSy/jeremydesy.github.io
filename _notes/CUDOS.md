Framework developed by Robert K. Merton, as a set of norms (a.k.a. Mertonian norms) for objective [[scientific method|science]].
Stands for
- Communism: data belong to the group
- Universalism: apply universal standards to claims & evidence, regardless of where they came from
- Disinterestedness: vigilance against potential conflicts that can influence the group's evaluation
- Organized Skepticism: discussion among the group to encourage engagement & dissent

Can be leveraged as rules for any truthseeking group.
