Entropy is the measure for the level of disorder of molecules in a system. The _more disorderly_ molecules are arranged, the _higher_ the entropy will be.
# What is dis-/order?
Disorder is the number of possible configurations of the molecules, which result in the same macro state.
### Illustration: mixing milk in coffee
When pouring milk in coffee, one can see the milk and coffee as two separate layers. In this initial state, switching two molecules could result in a different appearance (if one was switching a coffee and milk molecule). In other words, in this state, the number of configurations of the molecules yielding the same appearance is limited.
After stirring with a spoon, however, one can no longer see the difference between mil and coffee; they appear as one homogeneous liquid. In this state, no permutation of two molecules would change the macro state (appearance) of the whole. In other words, the number of configurations yielding the same appearance, is much larger.
