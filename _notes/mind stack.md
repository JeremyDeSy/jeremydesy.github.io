How are the body, [[mind]], [[meditation MOC|mediation]], [[philosophy]] and [[mental models]] all related?
My view of this is analogous to the technology stack:
- The body provides the sensory inputs (i.e. the hardware)
- [[consciousness|Consciousness]] collects, interprets and processes these inputs (i.e. the software) before feeding the outputs of this processing back to the body, to influence the outside world
-  The [[mind]] is the layer that connects the body and the (cognitive) mind.

[[meditation MOC|Meditation]] is aimed at training consciousness, in the sense of developing [[mindfulness]].
[[philosophy|Philosophy]] provides guidelines on how to deal with what appears in consciousness: which [[impression]] to acknowledge, ignore, etc.
At the highest cognitive layer, are general thinking tools (such as [[mental models]]), which provide support for focused cognitive processes (e.g. [[decision making]]).

Pursuing this analogy from the computer world, I would describe the mind as the following (software) stack:
1. [[consciousness|Consciousness]] is the deepest layer, interacting directly with the hardware
2. [[philosophy]] is a higher layer, providing guidelines on how to deal with what appears in consciousness (if at all)
4. [[mental models]] (and other general thinking tools) enable us to perform specific tasks within our general environment.
