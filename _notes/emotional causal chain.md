According to [[Stoicism]]the emotional causal chain runs as follows:
> impression > assent > impulse

The _impression_ is the automatic reaction, typically triggered by (one of) our senses. It is automatic because it doesn't originate from conscious thought (i.e. pre-cognitive).
The _assent_ is the cognitive confirmation of the initial impression.
The _impulse_ is the will towards a specific action. ^e8da30

Again, according to Stoicism:
- The impression is involuntary
- The assent is the result of reflection, for persons prone to contemplation. If not, it follows the impression automatically
- The impulse is voluntary, the outcome of a specific combination of impression and assent
