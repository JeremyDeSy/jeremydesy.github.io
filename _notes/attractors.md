Cycle of mutually reinforcing [[state of a system|states]] that allow processes to achieve a point of stability, not by losing energy until they stop but via [[dynamic equilibrium]].

E.g. [[homeostasis]]

Attracting [[state of a system|states]] have low surprise and high evidence (cf. [[Lyapunov function]]).
