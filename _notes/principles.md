# Living
- Let the hindsight of your future self, become the foresight of today’s self (see also [[meditation MOC#^d8327d|prospective retrospection]])
- Own it, fix it, learn from it
- Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance ("It’s the strong swimmers who drown")
- Be purposive about the next action - respond rather than react
- People know you by your actions, not your thoughts
- To get big things done, let small bad things happen
- The costs of your good [[habits]] are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future
- Weaknesses don't matter if you find solutions
- Compliment others more. Kindness has unlimited upside
- The best way to spend money is to buy time 
- Correct your mistakes before they become your habits
- Be an imperfectionist
- Focus on getting things right rather than being right ("outcome over ego")
- Give value before you ask for value
- Your effort sets your floor. Your strategy sets your ceiling
- Exercise voluntary discomfort
- The surest way to prevent yourself from learning a topic is to believe you already know it
- Uncertainty is part of life. We are typically less sure than we think. Practically nothing is  completely black or white ("wanna bet?") (see also [[space between uncertainty & certainty]])
- Whenever there is a gap between your habits and your goals, your habits will always win
- Be [[growth mindset|growth-oriented]] rather than goal-oriented
- Pain + reflection = progress
- Dare to look/be wrong
	- So much advantage in life comes from being willing to look like an idiot over the short term 
	- Trying and struggling looks like incompetence right up until the moment it looks like success
- To ask is a temporary shame, not to ask a life-long shame
- Start now, optimize later
	- Getting started changes everything
	- Writer vs editor: rewriting is easier than writing (ie create a draft afap and rewrite from there) 
- Not caring about winning trivial arguments saves so much time and energy
- Expecting is the greatest impediment to living. In anticipation of tomorrow, it loses today (Seneca)
- As a general rule, forgive anything but malicious intent. An understanding and forgiving approach works best most of the time
# Parenting
- Don't _give_ the answers, help them _find_ the answers. Teach them everything is figureoutable
- Be an ancestor rather than a ghost
- Show interest, ask what they did today
- Show up, right now
- [They owe you nothing](https://dailydad.com/they-owe-you-nothing)
# Thinking
- You can not produce above average results by thinking the same as everybody else (see also [[advantageous divergence]])
- Results do matter but if you optimize for the outcome, you win one time. If you optimize for a process that leads to great outcomes, you can win again and again (focus on process, not outcomes) (see also [[resulting]])
- When confronted with obstacles, we can first consider the conditions necessary to tackling them, not if we have the capacity to do so 
# Decision making
- Will this cost me time in the future or save me time in the future?
- If you want above average results, you have to say no to average opportunities
- When making uncertain decisions, it’s nearly always a mistake not to ask: What are the relevant [[priors]]? What might I already know that I can use to better understand the reality of the situation?
- Most failures are one-time costs. Most regrets are recurring costs. The pain of inaction stings longer than the pain of incorrect action

# Leadership
- Give away the credit. Take the blame.
