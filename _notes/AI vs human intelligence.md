When comparing [[artificial intelligence|AI]] with human intelligence, AI is often said to "behave as human intelligence". This implies that human intelligence somehow is the norm.
However, one could also consider that similarity by stating that both forms of intelligence are actually exhibits of the same underlying behavior/principle.

Could the underlying principle be [[active inference]]?
Why does AI sometimes seem so familiar to us?
