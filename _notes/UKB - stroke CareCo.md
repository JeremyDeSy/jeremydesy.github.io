# Hospital stakeholders
- Neurologists
- NIR
- Radiologists

# Needs
- Effective & automated CTP

# Workflow
## Current
- Steps
	1. Neurologist orders CT & activates stroke alert
	2. CT performed with/without CTP
	3. Radiologist looks at images and calls NIR (either on-site or at home)
	4. 4 stakeholders look at images: rad, neurologist, NIR & ???
- IV administered after NCCT (if no infarct or contra-indications)
- CTP only performed for patients with no infarction (cf. NCCT) & unknown time window
- Neurologists collect extensive timestamps already => good for TAT KPI
## Future

# Misc
- Leonie asked about iLVO (for full-body CT containing head CTA series)
