This pitch is built in layers (~ [[pedagogical approximation]]) and should be interleaved with [[intro meetings playbook]].

# Aidoc intro
## Layer 1
### Intro
- Aidoc is a leading provider of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] solutions for Radiology

### Why
- Our solutions focus on helping radiologists improve their workflow, in terms of quality and efficiency, in particular for acute/critical findings
- Our solutions are implemented in hundreds of sites worldwide already, and we see radiologists benefit from our solutions in three main areas (which have been documented in various studies & publications by our partners) (see also [[value propositions]])
	- Improving quality, by reducing the number of overlooked findings (subtle, outside radiologist's specialty, radiologists working under pressure, unexpected)
	- Reducing the time to treatment for acute or critical patients, by automatically flagging - and prioritizing - them in the workflow
	- Increasing productivity, by expediting read times
- We provide an [[Always-on AI]] platform that automatically (in the background):
	1. Retrieves and analyzes all relevant scans
	2. Detects a broad range of (acute or critical) pathologies
	3. Flags these findings in real-time for the radiologists
- Aidoc is one of the leaders in our (crowded and overhyped) space:
	- 10 CE marks & FDA clearances
	- Deployed in over 500 medical institutions
	- Consistent high (98%+) user engagement
	- Our partners have released multiple publications, demonstrating the benefits they obtained with our solutions

### How

### What

## Layer 2
- Hospitals experience [[2nd order thinking|2nd order]] benefits, in the reduction of [[length of stay]], both
	- In the ED
	- As [[hospital stays|inpatients]]
- We're not providing a feature-packed product, but rather a "safety net" (2nd pair of eyes) that will tap on your shoulder every now and then, making sure you saw (and are taking care of) what it detected
## Layer 3
- Key differentiators
	- AI development: combination of [[model- & data-centric AI approach]]

# Tactics
## Expectations management
- When people have unrealistic expectations (f.e. testing our solutions before deciding to try them clinically), is it better to push back or keep digging until you find another hook that resonates better?
	- Example with Leicester: they expected to do some offline testing of our solutions before taking further steps; I didn't push back on that and ended up discussing PERT, which resonated a lot; still be seen whether they will still expect some offline testing but it was an interesting turn of events => should I have pushed back immediately on the offline testing? If I had, we might not have gotten to discuss PERT; by doing that, I think they're more excited about working with us and it might therefore be easier to make them forego offline testing

# General
- What is you current experience with [[artificial intelligence|AI]]? 
- How do you expect AI to help you and/or impact your workflow?
- What is the cost of not implementing AI?

# Workflow
- What is your current average [[value propositions#Turnaround time prioritization|turnaround time]]?

# Value propositions
- For which of these [[value propositions]] would you expect AI's contribution/impact to be the greatest?
- How important are ROI analyses for purchasing decisions wrt Radiology solutions? How would you typically build such a case?

# Portfolio
- How relevant/important are our [[portfolio|current solutions]]?

# Communication
- How are critical findings communicated between Radiology & ED?
