Pattern of processing new information based on existing beliefs:
- Seeking out confirming evidence and barely doubting its validity (related to [[confirmation bias]])
- Ignoring or actively discrediting contradicting evidence.

This process strengthens our existing beliefs, which then influence how we process new information, and so on > [[vicious circle]]
