_Why believe in others_

During a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD1512_XJEw), Viktor Frankl used the analogy of flying with a crosswind, to illustrate his conviction of why it's important to believe in others.
When flying with crosswind, you have to steer against it in order to get to where you want; if not, you'll drift away from your objective.
Similarly (for Frankl), if you take man as he really is, you'll make him worse. However, if you overestimate/overrate him, you'll encourage him to be what he really can be, i.e. to actualize his potential.
