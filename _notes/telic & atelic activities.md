Telic activities are performed with a certain [[goal]] in mind, and have finite [[reward]].
Atelic activities are performed for their own sake, without a goal attached to them, and have (potentially) infinite reward.

Another difference between telic & atelic, is whether they can be _done_ (as in _completed_). Telic activities can be finished, atelic can't.

Yet another difference can be attained by viewing activities as journeys. Telic activities involve arriving somewhere; atelic don't (i.e. you're _already there_).

Telic activities will resonate better with people who are _goal-oriented_ while atelic activities will resonate with people who are [[growth mindset|growth-oriented]].
