Not all [[decision|decisions]] are created equal, therefore one should not use the same process for all types for decisions.
One approach to categorize decisions is depicted below.

This matrix defines the following types:
- Type 1: irreversible & consequential
- Type 2: other types

Type 1 decisions are those where we typically freeze up, because of the high stakes and lasting impact. These require a thorough [[decision making]] process.
Type 2 decisions can generally be taken more "easily", f.e.:
- Inconsequential decisions (in an organization) should be delegated to the lowest competent level
- Reversible & consequential decisions should be made gradually, effectively buying time to collect more evidence and turn back, if needed
