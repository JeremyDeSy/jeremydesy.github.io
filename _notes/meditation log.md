Advice from Sam in today's daily session:
- Instructions to look for the looker, the mind, consciousness, etc. can seem strange/impossible/confusing in the beginning
- As your ability to focus (pay attention) on any meditation object grows, these instructions will become easier to follow and notice that there is nothing to be found => this discovery itself feels like something ("you look for the center and it drops away, and then there's only experience/consciousness/the world") => notice what happens next
- Use the instructions (lightly) as pointers, notice any frustration as well and watch it pass away
- Listen to theory lessons in Illusory Self and Mysteries & Paradoxes sections
