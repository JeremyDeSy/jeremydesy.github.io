Ten considerations of poetic naturalism:
1. Life isn't forever
	- Life ends and that's part of what makes it special
	- Our lives are not dress rehearsals in which we plan and are tested in anticipation of the real show to come. This is it, the only performance we get to give, and it is what we make of it
